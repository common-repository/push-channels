== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want to create my own forms for getting my visitors to subscribe. Is that possible? =

Yes. While building your widgets, choose to style the widget yourself and then paste the styled widget code into the widget builder (under Widget design settings).

= I want my visitors to subscribe to all sections of my website. Can I build one widget to give them everything? =

Yes. Just build one widget and choose it each time you publish all of your content.

= Why can't I choose my "Wordpress Pages?" to publish to my Push Channels widgets =

Currently, our plugin only supports "Wordpress Posts" when choosing to which widgets to publish.

= When building a widget, what option do I choose for how I want my content pushed? =

Choose the "I will use the Push Channels API to push content"

= Can I use Push Channels on my website without using this Wordpress plugin? =

Yes. In fact, we built Push Channels prior to building this plugin. This plugin just allows for the integration portion of setting up Push Channels to be slightly easier.
